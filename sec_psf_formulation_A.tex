\section{Point Spread Function Formulation}
\label{sec:psfform}

Consider a single-conjugate, laser guide star adaptive optics
(LGS-AO) system, where a natural guide
star located at an angular sky position, $\boldsymbol{\theta_{ttgs}}$, is used for
tilt sensing and compensation and the laser located at an angular sky position,
$\boldsymbol{\theta_{lgs}}$ is used for high-order sensing and compensation. 
The science target of interest is offset from both the laser and the
tip-tilt guide star at position, $\boldsymbol{\theta_{sci}}$.  
Both the natural guide star used for tilt sensing and the science
target are effectively at infinite range while the laser guide star is
at $\sim$90 km. 
Figure \ref{fig:guide_star_schematic} displays a possible geometrical configuration for
such an AO system and observation.
