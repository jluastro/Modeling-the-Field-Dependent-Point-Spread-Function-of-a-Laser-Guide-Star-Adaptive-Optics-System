\section{Introduction}

Adaptive optics (AO) systems on large (8-10 m)
ground-based telescopes, such as at the W.~M.~Keck Observatory (WKMO),
provide some of the sharpest infrared astronomical images. 
High-resolution AO images and spectroscopy from WMKO have produced 
notable scientific results, including precise measurements of the mass
and distance of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center
\cite{Ghez:2008,Meyer:2016}, OTHERS. 
% AO images of stars orbiting close to this supermassive black
% hole have the potential to uniquely test general relativity in the strong
% gravity regime. However, 
Despite their success, current AO systems have not yet reached their
full potential due to our incomplete knowledge of the temporal and
spatial variations in the point spread function (PSF,
\cite{Davies:2012,Lu:2014}). 
Current astrometric and photometric limits are

Motivated by the need for improved astrometry and photometry in
Keck adaptive optics observations of crowded-fields, we have developed new
algorithms to reconstruct the spatial variation of the point-spread
function (PSF). 
These algorithms are deployed in a software package called
 AIROPA ({\it A}nisoplanatic and {\it I}nstrumental {\it
  R}econstruction of {\it O}ff-axis {\it P}SFs for {\it A}O) to
account for the spatial and temporal variations of the PSF.
