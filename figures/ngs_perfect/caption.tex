The PSF ({\em left}) and OTF ({\em right}) for an on-axis ({\em top}) and 5'' off-axis ({\em bottom}) science target for an on-axis natural guide star at a zenith angle of 40$^\circ$. 
The PSF was computed at a wavelength of $\lambda = 2.15 \micron$ assuming a perfect AO system and instrument, and only atmospheric anisoplanatism as described by Equation \ref{eqn:lgsotfa}.
