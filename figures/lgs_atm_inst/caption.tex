The PSF ({\em top}) and OTF ({\em bottom}) for a science target that is on-axis ({\em left}), 5'' off-axis and suffering from anisoplanatism ({\em middle}), and 5'' off-axis and with both anisoplanatism and instrumental aberrations ({\em right}). In this case, the laser guide star and natural tip-tilt star are on-axis at a zenith angle of 40$^\circ$. 
The PSF was computed at a wavelength of $\lambda = 2.15 \micron$ assuming a perfect AO system, and only atmospheric anisoplanatism and instrumental aberrations were included, 
as described by Equation \ref{eqn:lgsotfc}.
