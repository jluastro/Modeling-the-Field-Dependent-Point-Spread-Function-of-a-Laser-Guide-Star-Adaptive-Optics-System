A ray emitted by a source at altitude $\mathcal{R}_{a}$ and lateral offset $\vec{r}_{a}$ descends through turbulence to arrive at a location $\vec{r}$ in the telescope pupil plane.  The wavefront phase aberration at location $\vec{r}$ is proportional to the integral of the index of refraction $n \left( \vec{r}\left[1-z/\mathcal{R}_{a}\right] + \vec{r}_{a} z/\mathcal{R}_{a}, \; z\right)$ 
along the geometric path.
