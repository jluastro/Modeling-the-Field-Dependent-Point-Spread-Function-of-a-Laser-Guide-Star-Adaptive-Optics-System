A possible geometrical configuration for the science target, tip tilt guide star, and laser guide star in the Earth's atmosphere ({\em left}) and on the final focal plane ({\em right}). Light from each of these targets traverses atmospheric turbulence along different paths, thereby acquiring differential wavefront aberrations. The sources' different locations in the field of view leads to angular anisoplanatism, the sources' different vertical heights in the atmosphere lead to focal anisoplanatism.
